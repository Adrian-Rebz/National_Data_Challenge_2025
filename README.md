## 📊 Dashboard Insights Summary

### ⏱️ Downtime Overview
- Total Downtime accounts for **56%** of total production time (23.13 out of 41.17 hours), indicating significant room for process improvement.
- Overall production efficiency is **64%**, which is below the world-class benchmark of 85%.

### ⚙️ Top Downtime Contributors
- **Machine Adjustment (5.53 hrs)** and **Machine Failure (4.23 hrs)** are the top causes, making up **~43%** of total downtime.
- **Inventory Shortage (3.75 hrs)** highlights potential supply chain or planning issues.

### 📦 Product-Level Analysis
- **CO-600** had the highest production (15.00 hrs) and downtime (8.23 hrs), accounting for **35.6%** of all downtime.
- **OR-600** had more downtime than production time (1.25 hrs vs. 1.00 hr), signaling serious inefficiencies.

### 👨‍🏭 Operator-Level Performance
- **Charlie** handled the most batches (11) and had the highest downtime (6.40 hrs).
- **Mac** showed the lowest efficiency (61%), suggesting issues with familiarity or workflow pacing.
- Efficiency across all operators ranged narrowly (61%-67%), implying value in standardization or retraining.

### 🧩 Downtime Cause by Product
- **Machine Adjustment** was most severe in **RB-600 (2.25 hrs)** and **CO-2L (2.00 hrs)**.
- **Machine Failure** affected **CO-600** the most (1.93 hrs), pointing to mechanical concerns.
- **Inventory Shortages** and **Batch Changes** were distributed across products, possibly indicating systemic scheduling or flow issues.

### ❗ Error Attribution
- **Operator Errors** caused 56% of downtime incidents — emphasizing the need for SOP reviews and focused operator training.
